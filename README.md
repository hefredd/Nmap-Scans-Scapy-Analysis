This repository documents an exploration into fundamental network reconnaissance and analysis techniques using essential ethical hacking tools like Nmap, tcpdump, and Scapy.
The primary goals of this project were to:
   1.Network Discovery: Identify live hosts on a local network segment.
   2.Service and OS Fingerprinting: Determine the operating system and running services (especially SMB/NetBIOS) on a target host.
   3.Vulnerability Enumeration: Utilize Nmap scripting engine (NSE) for basic service enumeration (e.g., SMB share listing).
   4.Packet Capture and Analysis: Use tcpdump for low-level network traffic capture and Scapy for advanced interactive packet inspection and manipulation.
   5.Network Configuration Review: Review host network settings (ifconfig, ip route, DNS configuration).

The commands were executed in a controlled, isolated lab environment targeting a host at the IP address 10.6.6.23 within the 10.6.6.0/24 subnet.

1. Host Reconnaissance (Nmap & SMB)
   1. nmap -sn 10.6.6.0/24: Quickly identifies all active IP addresses in the 10.6.6.0/24 subnet.
   2. sudo nmap -O 10.6.6.23: Fingerprinting: Identifies the OS of the target 10.6.6.23
   3. nmap -p21 -sV -A -T4 10.6.6.23: Service Detail: Finds if FTP is running, its version, and extracts comprehensive details from the target.
   4. nmap -A p139, p445 10.6.6.23: SMB/NetBIOS Status: Confirms if the target is running SMB/CIFS, which is common on Windows machines.
   5. nmap --script smb-enum-shares.nse -p445 10.6.6.23: Enumeration: Attempts to list accessible SMB shares on the target, a critical step in reconnaissance.
   6. smbclient //10.6.6.23/print$ -N: Share Access Test: Confirms the ability to connect to a specific share, validating the share enumeration results.

2. Local Network Configuration
   1. ifconfig: IP/MAC Address: Shows the host's IP, subnet mask, and MAC address.
   2. ip route: Gateway: Identifies the default gateway/router for outgoing traffic.
   3. cat /etc/resolv.conf: DNS Servers: Identifies the DNS servers used for name resolution.
3. Deep Packet Analysis (tcpdump & Scapy)
   1. Capturing General Internet Traffic
       This demonstrates Scapy's basic sniff() function to capture traffic generated by a standard DNS resolution and ping.
       sudo su
       scapy
       sniff()
       paro=_
       paro.summary()

   2. Capturing Local Bridge/Broadcast Traffic
        This targets traffic on a specific virtual bridge interface, often used in lab environments, and includes a simple browser request.
        sniff(iface="br-internal") 
        Open browser and type 10.6.6.23 (Generates HTTP/TCP traffic)
        ctrl +c to stop sniffing
        paro2=_
        paro2.summary()
   3. Filtering for ICMP Traffic
        This showcases Scapy's filtering capability to capture only a specified number of packets (count=5) of a particular type (filter="icmp").
        sniff(iface="br-internal" ,filter ="icmp",count=5)
        Open new terminal and run: ping 10.6.6.23
        ctrl +c (to stop ping terminal) 
        ctrl +c (to stop scapy terminal)
        paro3=_
        paro3.summary() 
        paro3[3]
